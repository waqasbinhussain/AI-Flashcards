      { q: "What is Artificial Intelligence (AI)?", a: "AI is the simulation of human intelligence in machines, enabling them to perform tasks like reasoning, learning, and decision-making." },
      { q: "What are the three main types of AI?", a: "1. Narrow AI 2. General AI 3. Super AI" },
      { q: "What is a model in AI?", a: "A model is a trained system that makes predictions or decisions based on input data." },
      { q: "What is training in machine learning?", a: "It’s the process of teaching a model using labeled data to learn patterns and make predictions." },
      { q: "What is data in AI?", a: "Data is the input from which AI learns. It can be structured or unstructured, labeled or unlabeled." },
      { q: "What is an algorithm?", a: "A step-by-step method the computer uses to solve problems." },
      { q: "What’s the relationship between AI, ML, and DL?", a: "ML is a subset of AI; DL is a subset of ML. AI ⊃ ML ⊃ DL" },
      { q: "What is Supervised Learning?", a: "Learning from labeled data — the model is trained with known inputs and outputs." },
      { q: "Two subtypes of Supervised Learning?", a: "Classification (predict categories), Regression (predict values)" },
      { q: "Example of Classification?", a: "Spam vs Non-Spam email detection" },
      { q: "Example of Regression?", a: "Predicting house prices or exam scores" },
      { q: "What is Unsupervised Learning?", a: "Learning without labeled data — the model finds patterns or groups in the input." },
      { q: "Example of Unsupervised Learning?", a: "Customer segmentation, grouping users by behavior" },
      { q: "What is Reinforcement Learning?", a: "The model learns by doing — receiving rewards or penalties to optimize its actions." },
      { q: "Main components of RL?", a: "Agent, Environment, State, Action, Reward" },
      { q: "What is labeled data?", a: "Data with input and corresponding output, used in supervised learning." },
      { q: "What is structured data?", a: "Data organized in rows/columns, like in databases or Excel." },
      { q: "What is unstructured data?", a: "Raw data like images, videos, audio, or text without a fixed format." },
      { q: "What is Prompt Engineering?", a: "The skill of crafting clear instructions to get useful responses from AI models." },
      { q: "Why is prompt engineering important?", a: "A well-structured prompt gets better, more accurate results from an AI." },
      { q: "Supervised Learning applications?", a: "Email filtering, loan approval, handwriting recognition" },
      { q: "Unsupervised Learning applications?", a: "Product recommendations, fraud detection, clustering" },
      { q: "Reinforcement Learning applications?", a: "Gaming AI, self-driving cars, robotics, dynamic pricing" },
      { q: "Predicted value AI will add by 2030?", a: "$13 trillion globally" },
      { q: "Common myth about GPT-4?", a: "That it’s just a bigger GPT-3 — but GPT-4 also has smarter training and better reasoning." }
